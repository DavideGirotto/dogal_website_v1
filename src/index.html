							Dogal takes its name from the word “Doge,” historically the head and iconic symbol of the city of Venice and its prosperity and prestige in the world.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Brand is inspired by Venice – a unique city, the crossroads of culture, art and beauty – and by the people so extraordinary who have made it great.
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="column is-1"></div>
					
					<div class="column is-3">

							It inspired so many Venetian merchants and explorers who imprinted on Venice their longing for new horizons, cultures and riches. An attitude which urged Marco Polo, the most famous among the explorers, to travel along the Silk Road all the way to remote China, becoming a trustworthy friend of the Emperor himself.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It is inspired by the very first Venetians, who imagined and founded the city on water, making the impossible possible. They bestowed forever on Venice the power of their vision.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="column is-1"></div>

					<div class="column is-3">
						<p>
							And, moreover, it inspired its indomitable navigators and commanders like Doge Enrico Dandolo, who perservered for more than 30 years in his dream to reconquer Constantinopole, the richest city of its time, and with his naval victory, consecrating Venice as the queen of the seas.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This vision, yearning for knowledge and courage become values of identity for Dogal. Similar is the love for the arts and the excellant Venetian craftsmanship in the service of Beauty. Values of a tradition which the founders of Dogal, Venetians from generations linked to the art of glass and the ancient art of gold beating, take over to affirm a Brand with a unique and inimitable style.

							The Dogal bottles are a tribute to the excellent arts and crafts which for centuries enhanced Venice.
						</p>

						<p>
							The splendor of the bottles originates through references to the architecture of the Venetian palaces, and to the precious fabrics, whose tactical sensation the Brand “evokes,” to the art of Murano glass and the joy of its colors, and to the gold worked so expertly by the finest Venetian jewelers.
						</p>

						<p>
							Color is an element of identity, effusive expression of character, happiness and lightness.
